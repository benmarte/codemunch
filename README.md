## The problem

When Claude Code explores a codebase, the naive approach is to read whole files. An 800-line file costs ~8,000 tokens. Read ten files to find one function and you've burned 80,000 tokens before writing a single line of code.

**codemunch fixes this.** It auto-indexes your codebase and lets Claude fetch the exact 20 lines it needs instead of the 800-line file. No setup required — just start using it.

```
Without codemunch:  read auth.ts (800 lines) → ~8,000 tokens
With codemunch:     fetch validateToken()     →    ~35 tokens

Savings: 99.6%
```

---

## Why use codemunch?

Claude Code bills by token. Every file read costs tokens — and most of those tokens are wasted on code you didn't need to see.

| Scenario | Without codemunch | With codemunch | Savings |
|---|---|---|---|
| Find a function | Read full file (~8,000 tokens) | `search` + `fetch` (~47 tokens) | **99.4%** |
| Trace all usages of a symbol | Read 14 files (~112,000 tokens) | `refs` (~45 tokens) | **99.96%** |
| Understand project structure | Read 10+ files (~80,000 tokens) | `explore` (~200 tokens) | **99.75%** |
| Typical debugging session (30 lookups) | ~240,000 tokens | ~1,200 tokens | **99.5%** |

### Benchmarked context savings

We benchmarked codemunch against two real open-source repos — running 5 typical exploration tasks on each and measuring token consumption with vs without codemunch:

| Repo | Size | Traditional | codemunch | Savings |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [expressjs/cors](https://github.com/expressjs/cors) | 6 files, ~8K tokens | 18,810 tokens | 1,281 tokens | **93.2%** |
| [koajs/koa](https://github.com/koajs/koa) | 82 files, ~52K tokens | 24,565 tokens | 2,316 tokens | **90.6%** |
| **Combined (10 tasks)** | **88 files** | **43,375 tokens** | **3,597 tokens** | **91.7%** |

Best case: **98.6% savings** (finding all references to a function — `refs` instead of grep + reading files).
Worst case: **69.8% savings** (multi-fetch of related functions — still cheaper than reading one full file).

> Full benchmark methodology and per-task breakdown: [docs/benchmark-results.md](docs/benchmark-results.md)

That's **~12x less context usage** on average, which means:

- **Longer conversations** — you stay well within Claude's context window instead of hitting limits mid-task
- **Lower costs** — fewer tokens consumed per task directly reduces your API bill
- **Faster responses** — less input for Claude to process means quicker replies
- **Better results** — Claude sees only the relevant code, not thousands of lines of noise, leading to more focused and accurate responses

---

## How it works

codemunch uses a **three-tier engine** — it picks the best available tool per language and falls back automatically. No configuration required.

```
Tier 1 — LSP (Language Server)
  Byte-exact symbol boundaries, type signatures, cross-file references.
  Same engine powering "Go to Definition" in VS Code.
         ↓ not available?
Tier 2 — Universal ctags
  40+ languages. Near-exact boundaries. Ships with most Unix systems.
         ↓ not available?
Tier 3 — ripgrep
  Works on literally any language via regex patterns.
  If rg is installed, codemunch works.
```

### Auto-indexing

**You never need to manually index.** codemunch automatically:

- **First use**: Detects your stack, configures engines, and builds the full index when you run any command
- **Subsequent uses**: Checks if files have changed since the last index and incrementally re-indexes only what's different
- **Incremental updates**: Tracks git blob hashes per file — only re-processes files that actually changed

```
First /codemunch:search → auto-detects stack → builds full index → runs your search
Next  /codemunch:fetch  → checks git diff → 2 files changed → re-indexes those 2 → fetches symbol
Later /codemunch:refs   → checks git diff → no changes → runs immediately
```

---

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Add the marketplace and install the plugin
/plugin marketplace add benmarte/codemunch
/plugin install codemunch@codemunch

# 2. Start using it — indexing happens automatically
/codemunch:explore

# 3. Search for symbols
/codemunch:search validateToken

# 4. Read just that function — not the whole file
/codemunch:fetch validateToken

# 5. Find every place it's called
/codemunch:refs validateToken
```

That's it. No `/codemunch:index` needed. No config files to create. Just install and use.

---

## User guide

### Exploring a new codebase

When you first open a project, start with `/codemunch:explore` to get the lay of the land:

```bash
# Get a bird's-eye view of the whole project
/codemunch:explore

# Drill into a specific directory
/codemunch:explore src/api/

# Outline a single file
/codemunch:explore src/api/invoices.ts
```

This shows you the class hierarchy, entry points, and largest symbols — all without reading any source files. Token cost: under 200.

### Finding symbols

Use `/codemunch:search` for all symbol lookups — it handles both fuzzy name matching and structured filters:

```bash
# Fuzzy name search
/codemunch:search validate          # matches validateToken, validateEmail, etc.
/codemunch:search AuthService       # exact class name
/codemunch:search inv               # matches Invoice, invalidate, invoiceRouter

# Filter by kind
/codemunch:search kind:class        # all classes
/codemunch:search kind:interface    # all interfaces
/codemunch:search kind:method       # all methods

# Filter by file
/codemunch:search file:auth         # symbols in auth-related files

# Filter by container (class/module)
/codemunch:search in:AuthService    # methods on AuthService

# Filter by signature
/codemunch:search sig:Promise       # functions returning Promise

# Combine filters
/codemunch:search kind:method in:Invoice              # Invoice methods
/codemunch:search validate kind:function              # functions named "validate*"
/codemunch:search kind:interface file:api             # interfaces in api files
```

Output:
```
Found 6 symbols matching "validate":

  1.  validateToken     function   src/auth/tokens.ts:142      AuthService
  2.  validateInvoice   function   src/lib/validation.ts:89    —
  3.  validateAmount    function   src/lib/validation.ts:112   —
  4.  validateEmail     method     src/models/user.ts:34       UserModel
  5.  validateExpense   function   convex/expenses.ts:67       —
  6.  validateDate      function   src/utils/dates.ts:23       —

Use /codemunch:fetch <name> to read the source of any symbol.
Tokens used: 12
```

### Reading symbol source

Once you've found what you need, use `/codemunch:fetch` to read just that symbol:

```bash
/codemunch:fetch validateToken
/codemunch:fetch AuthService
/codemunch:fetch getUserById
```

Output:
```
📍 validateToken  [function]  src/auth/tokens.ts:142–163
   Signature: validateToken(token: string): Promise<User | null>
   Container: AuthService  |  References: 14
   ─────────────────────────────────────────
   async function validateToken(token: string): Promise<User | null> {
     ...20 lines of source...
   }
   ─────────────────────────────────────────
   Tokens: ~35  (saved ~8,400 vs reading full file)
```

If the same name exists in multiple files, you'll get a numbered disambiguation list.

### Finding references

Use `/codemunch:refs` to find every place a symbol is used:

```bash
/codemunch:refs validateToken
```

Output:
```
14 references to validateToken:

  src/api/auth.ts:23          authRouter.post('/login', validateToken, ...)
  src/api/invoices.ts:45      export const getInvoice = [validateToken, ...]
  src/middleware/index.ts:12  app.use('/api', validateToken)
  tests/auth.test.ts:34       await validateToken('expired-token')
  ...

Tokens: ~45  (saved ~42,000 vs reading 14 files)
```

Uses LSP for semantic precision (no false positives from comments or strings); falls back to ripgrep.

### Checking status

See your engine config, index freshness, and session savings:

```bash
/codemunch:status

For any other language, add custom patterns to `.claude/codemunch/config.json`:

```json
{
  "custom_patterns": {
    "solidity": {
      "function": "^\\s*(function|modifier|event)\\s+(\\w+)",
      "class":    "^(contract|library|interface)\\s+(\\w+)"
    },
    "hcl": {
      "function": "^(resource|data|module|variable|output)\\s+\"(\\w+)\"\\s+\"(\\w+)\""
    },
    "prisma": {
      "class": "^(model|enum)\\s+(\\w+)\\s+\\{"
    }
  }
}
```

## Requirements

**Claude Code** — this is a Claude Code plugin, not an MCP server.

For the best experience, install **all** of the following. codemunch uses them as a fallback chain (LSP → ctags → ripgrep), so having all three ensures maximum precision and coverage:

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install universal-ctags ripgrep jq

# Ubuntu / Debian
apt install universal-ctags ripgrep jq

# Windows (Scoop)
scoop install ctags ripgrep jq
```

| Tool | Why | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| **LSP server** | Most precise — exact types, signatures, cross-file references. Usually already installed if you use VS Code. | Recommended |
| **universal-ctags** | Fast symbol extraction for 40+ languages. Used when LSP isn't available for a language. | Recommended |
| **ripgrep** | Last-resort pattern matching. Also used for reference search fallback. | Recommended |
| **jq** | Fast JSON index queries. Falls back to Python if unavailable. | Optional |

codemunch works with just **one** of the above, but having all three gives you the best results — LSP for precision, ctags for breadth, and ripgrep as a safety net.

**No Python packages. No npm install. No compilation.**

---

## Installation

```bash
# Add the marketplace and install
/plugin marketplace add benmarte/codemunch
/plugin install codemunch@codemunch
```

Then run the one-time init to make Claude use codemunch automatically:
```bash
/codemunch:init
```

This adds instructions to your project's `CLAUDE.md` so Claude **automatically** uses codemunch for all code exploration — you never have to type `/codemunch:search` yourself. Claude will just do it whenever it needs to find or read code.

Alternatively, add the instructions manually to your project's `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## Code Exploration (codemunch)

When exploring, searching, or reading code, ALWAYS prefer codemunch over reading full files:

- **Finding symbols**: Use `/codemunch:search <query>` instead of Grep or Glob to find functions,
  classes, methods, or types. Supports filters: `kind:class`, `file:auth`, `in:ClassName`,
  `sig:ReturnType`.
- **Reading code**: Use `/codemunch:fetch <name>` instead of Read to view a specific function or
  class. This reads only the relevant lines (~35 tokens) instead of the whole file (~8,000 tokens).
- **Understanding structure**: Use `/codemunch:explore [path]` instead of reading multiple files to
  understand project layout, class hierarchies, and entry points.
- **Finding usages**: Use `/codemunch:refs <name>` instead of Grep to find all references to a symbol.
- **Only use Read** when you need to Edit a file, since Edit requires file content in context.

The index auto-updates — no manual indexing needed.
```

After init (or manual setup), just talk to Claude normally:
```
"Fix the bug in the validateToken function"
→ Claude auto-uses /codemunch:search to find it, /codemunch:fetch to read it, then fixes it

"How does the auth flow work?"
→ Claude auto-uses /codemunch:explore and /codemunch:refs to trace the flow
```

---

## The index file

codemunch writes `.claude/codemunch/index.json` to your project and adds `.claude/codemunch/` to your `.gitignore` automatically. The index is a flat JSON file — no database, no daemon, no background process.

Each symbol entry:
```json
{
  "name": "validateToken",
  "kind": "function",
  "file": "src/auth/tokens.ts",
  "start_line": 142,
  "end_line": 163,
  "signature": "validateToken(token: string): Promise<User | null>",
  "container": "AuthService",
  "engine": "lsp"
}
```

The index also tracks `file_hashes` — a mapping of each file to its git blob hash. This powers incremental re-indexing: when you edit 3 files, only those 3 are re-processed instead of the entire project.

You never need to manually re-index. The index auto-updates when any query command detects stale files. If you want a clean rebuild, use `/codemunch:index --force`.

## FAQ

**Do I have to type `/codemunch:search` every time?**

No. Run `/codemunch:init` once per project — it adds instructions to your `CLAUDE.md` so Claude automatically uses codemunch whenever it needs to explore code. You just talk to Claude normally and it uses codemunch behind the scenes.

**Do I need to run `/codemunch:index` before using other commands?**

No. The index builds automatically on first use and stays up-to-date via incremental re-indexing. You never need to think about it.

**How does auto-indexing work?**

Every query command (search, fetch, refs, explore) runs a lightweight staleness check first. It compares the index timestamp against `git diff` to find changed files. If files changed, only those files are re-indexed. If no index exists, a full index is built. The overhead for a fresh index is negligible (<100ms).

**What if the same function name exists in multiple files?**

`fetch` shows a numbered disambiguation list and asks which one you want.

**Does this work with monorepos?**

Yes. Run any command from the repo root. Use `file:` filters in search to scope to a specific package.

**Does codemunch send my code anywhere?**

No. Everything stays local. The index lives in `.claude/codemunch/` in your project. No network calls.

**Why not just use LSP directly?**

codemunch does use LSP for operations that need it (refs, hover, rename). The index layer adds fast offline search without spinning up a language server for every lookup, plus ctags/rg fallback for languages without an LSP.

**Can I force a full re-index?**

Yes: `/codemunch:index --force` rebuilds from scratch.

## Inspiration

Conceptually inspired by [jgravelle/jcodemunch-mcp](https://github.com/jgravelle/jcodemunch-mcp) — a Python MCP server using tree-sitter for symbol-based retrieval. This plugin is an independent reimplementation as a native Claude Code plugin: no shared code, no Python dependency, 40+ languages via the LSP/ctags/rg tier system.
